# CSS File Cleanup Plan

## Current Issue
You have 3 base CSS files but only 1 is actually being used:

### Files Analysis:
- **`base.css`** (352 lines) ✅ **ACTIVE** - Loaded in theme.liquid
- **`base-backup.css`** (4,665 lines) ❌ **UNUSED** - Not loaded anywhere
- **`base-new.css`** (177 lines) ❌ **UNUSED** - Not loaded anywhere

## Problem Discovered
During our spacing fixes, we mistakenly modified `base-backup.css` instead of the active `base.css` file! This means our spacing fixes weren't actually applied since the backup file isn't loaded.

## Solution Applied

### ✅ Fixed the Active File
- Added missing `.page-section` class definition to `base.css`
- Now the spacing fixes will actually work since it's in the loaded file

### 🗑️ Recommended Cleanup
The unused files should be removed to eliminate confusion:

```bash
# Remove unused CSS files
rm /workspaces/AAI/assets/base-backup.css
rm /workspaces/AAI/assets/base-new.css
```

### 📋 Why This Cleanup is Safe:
1. **`base-backup.css`**: Not referenced in any `.liquid` files
2. **`base-new.css`**: Not referenced in any `.liquid` files  
3. **`base.css`**: This is the only one actually being used

### 🎯 Benefits:
- **Clarity**: Only one base CSS file to maintain
- **Performance**: Smaller theme package size
- **Accuracy**: Changes actually get applied (no more editing wrong files!)
- **Maintenance**: Developers know exactly which file to modify

### 📝 Updated CSS Loading Order:
```
variables.css          ← CSS custom properties
reset.css             ← Browser reset
containers.css        ← Layout containers  
utilities.css         ← Utility classes
buttons.css           ← Button components
base.css              ← Base styles (ACTIVE)
color-schemes.css     ← Theme colors
spacing-reset.css     ← Spacing system
```

## Files That Can Be Safely Deleted:
- `assets/base-backup.css` (4,665 lines of unused code)
- `assets/base-new.css` (177 lines of unused code)

This will remove **4,842 lines** of dead code from your theme!
