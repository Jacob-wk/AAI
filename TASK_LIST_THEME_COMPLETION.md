# Task List for Theme Completion
*Comprehensive action plan for AAI theme launch readiness*

## Overview

This task list provides a detailed roadmap to complete the AAI theme development, organized by priority and dependencies. Based on the audit findings and architectural analysis, here's what needs to be done to achieve launch readiness.

## Current Status Assessment

### ✅ **Strengths (What's Working Well)**
- **Strong AAI Custom Sections**: 27 well-designed sections with good functionality
- **Comprehensive Templates**: 30 template files covering all page types
- **Modern Styling**: Good CSS architecture with component-based approach
- **E-commerce Integration**: Cart, product, and collection functionality working
- **Content Management**: Flexible content building with universal sections

### ⚠️ **Critical Issues (Blocking Launch)**
1. **Generic Wrapper Sections**: `_blocks.liquid` and `section.liquid` causing "Edit code" issues
2. **Contact Form**: Block-based form needs proper section-level implementation
3. **Cart Quantity Counter**: Not updating on add-to-cart without refresh
4. **AI Block Generation**: Blocked by generic section architecture

### 🎯 **Enhancement Opportunities**
1. **Collection Pages**: Styling needs improvement
2. **404 Page**: Still using base styling
3. **Code Selling App**: Integration needed
4. **Final Polish**: Various UX improvements
