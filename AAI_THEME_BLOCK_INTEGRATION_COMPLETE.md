- Streamlined settings to focus on essential layout and styling options

### 2. AAI Universal Hero Section (`/workspaces/AAI/sections/aai-universal-hero.liquid`)

**Template Changes:**

## Technical Implementation Details

### Theme Block Styling Strategy
1. **Automatic Inheritance**: Theme blocks automatically inherit AAI styles through CSS selectors
2. **Layout Contexts**: Different layouts (timeline, grid, overlay) provide contextual styling
3. **Visual Consistency**: Maintained AAI color scheme, typography, and spacing
4. **Interactive Elements**: Hover effects and transitions preserved

### Content Migration Path
- Existing custom block content can be recreated using Horizon theme blocks
- Text blocks → Use Horizon `text.liquid` block
- Feature lists → Use Horizon `text.liquid` with structured content
- Credential grids → Use Horizon `group.liquid` with multiple `text.liquid` blocks
- Contact forms → Use dedicated form sections or blocks

### Maintenance Benefits
- Reduced custom code maintenance burden
- Leverages Horizon's proven, tested block system
- Automatic compatibility with future Horizon updates
- Simplified debugging and support

## Result
The AAI sections now combine the best of both worlds:
- **AI Generation**: Full compatibility with Shopify's AI content generation
- **Educational Branding**: Maintains AAI's professional training industry focus
- **Design Consistency**: Preserves carefully crafted educational styling
- **Future-Proof**: Built on Shopify 2.0 best practices and Horizon's architecture

The "Generate" button should now appear in the theme customizer for both sections, enabling AI-assisted content creation while maintaining the AAI educational brand experience.
