# Cart Drawer - Standard Files Deletion Complete ✅

## Status: SUCCESSFULLY DELETED

The old standard cart drawer files have been completely removed from the project. The TypeScript errors you were seeing for `/workspaces/AAI/assets/standard-cart-drawer.js` were from VS Code's language server cache, which should clear automatically.

## Files Deleted:
- ❌ `snippets/standard-cart-drawer.liquid` - REMOVED
- ❌ `assets/standard-cart-drawer.js` - REMOVED

## Current Cart Drawer Implementation:
- ✅ `snippets/cart-drawer.liquid` - Clean implementation with native dialog
- ✅ `assets/cart-drawer.js` - TypeScript-compliant implementation
- ✅ `assets/cart-styling.css` - Proper right-slide animations
- ✅ `snippets/header-actions.liquid` - Clean integration

## Verification Results:
✅ Standard cart drawer files completely removed  
✅ No references to standard cart drawer in active code  
✅ Only test scripts mention them (for verification)  
✅ No CSS conflicts detected  
✅ Native dialog implementation working  
✅ TypeScript errors should clear after cache refresh  

## Next Steps:
The cart drawer implementation is now clean and ready. If you're still seeing TypeScript errors for the deleted files, try:

1. **Restart VS Code** - This will clear the language server cache
2. **Reload Window** - Use Ctrl+Shift+P → "Developer: Reload Window"
3. **Clear TypeScript Cache** - The errors should disappear automatically

## Current Cart Drawer Features:
- Right-slide animation from `translateX(100%)` to `translateX(0)`
- Native HTML dialog with proper modal behavior
- 300ms smooth transitions with cubic-bezier easing
- Mobile responsive (100vw on mobile, 400px max on desktop)
- Proper backdrop overlay with fade animation
- TypeScript-compliant JavaScript with null safety checks

The cart drawer is production-ready and fully functional!
