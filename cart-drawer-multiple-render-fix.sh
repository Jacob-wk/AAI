echo "🎯 CART DRAWER MULTIPLE RENDERING FIX"
echo "====================================="
echo "Date: $(date)"
echo ""

echo "✅ ISSUE IDENTIFIED:"
echo "   Cart drawer was being rendered in multiple locations:"
echo "   • snippets/header-actions.liquid"
echo "   • sections/aai-header.liquid" 
echo "   • sections/main-cart.liquid"
echo "   This caused duplicate elements and JavaScript conflicts"
echo ""

echo "✅ FIXES APPLIED:"
echo "   1. Removed cart drawer render from header-actions.liquid"
echo "   2. Removed cart drawer render from aai-header.liquid"
echo "   3. Removed cart drawer render from main-cart.liquid"
echo "   4. Added single cart drawer render to theme.liquid globally"
echo "   5. Enhanced logging in cart-drawer.js for debugging"
echo ""

echo "🔍 VERIFICATION:"
echo "   Checking cart drawer renders..."

# Count how many times cart-drawer is rendered
RENDER_COUNT=$(grep -r "render 'cart-drawer'" /workspaces/AAI/snippets/ /workspaces/AAI/sections/ /workspaces/AAI/layout/ 2>/dev/null | grep -v ".backup" | wc -l)
echo "   Total cart drawer renders found: $RENDER_COUNT"

if [ "$RENDER_COUNT" -eq 1 ]; then
  echo "   ✅ Only one cart drawer render found (correct)"
  echo "   Location:"
  grep -rn "render 'cart-drawer'" /workspaces/AAI/layout/ 2>/dev/null
else
  echo "   ❌ Multiple cart drawer renders still exist:"
  grep -rn "render 'cart-drawer'" /workspaces/AAI/snippets/ /workspaces/AAI/sections/ /workspaces/AAI/layout/ 2>/dev/null | grep -v ".backup"
fi

echo ""
echo "✅ EXPECTED RESULTS:"
echo "   • Only one cart drawer element on page"
echo "   • Console logging should show cart drawer connection"
echo "   • Auto-open functionality should work correctly"
echo "   • Add-to-cart events should trigger cart drawer"
echo ""

echo "🧪 TESTING STEPS:"
echo "   1. Open browser console"
echo "   2. Go to any product page"
echo "   3. Look for '🛒 Cart drawer connected!' message"
echo "   4. Add item to cart"
echo "   5. Check for auto-open event logs"
echo "   6. Verify cart drawer opens (not /cart redirect)"
echo ""

echo "🚀 STATUS: READY FOR TESTING"
