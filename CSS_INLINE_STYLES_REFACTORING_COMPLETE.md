## Technical Implementation

### CSS File Organization
```
assets/
├── customer-account-simple.css     # Customer account dashboard styles
├── course-access-simple.css        # Course access display styles  
├── product-form-course.css         # Course enrollment form styles
└── ... (existing CSS files)
```

### Liquid Template Updates
Each template now includes proper CSS asset loading:
```liquid
{{ 'css-filename.css' | asset_url | stylesheet_tag }}
```

## Remaining Inline Styles
Some inline styles remain in the theme but are part of the original theme structure:
- `snippets/variant-main-picker.liquid` - Theme core functionality
- `snippets/cart-drawer.liquid` - Theme core functionality  
- `blocks/_header-logo.liquid` - Theme core functionality
- Others are part of existing theme components

## Next Steps
1. **Test CSS Loading** - Verify all styles load correctly on storefront
2. **Performance Validation** - Check page load times improved
3. **Browser Testing** - Ensure consistent styling across browsers
4. **Cache Testing** - Verify CSS files are properly cached

## Files Created
- `assets/customer-account-simple.css` (163 lines)
- `assets/course-access-simple.css` (183 lines)  
- `assets/product-form-course.css` (126 lines)
