## 🎯 **Priority Matrix**

### **🚨 CRITICAL (Must Fix Day 1)**
1. **"Edit code" opens wrong file** → Delete `_blocks.liquid`
2. **Contact form too narrow/broken** → Create proper section
3. **No AI block generation** → Add storytelling categories

### **🔧 HIGH (Must Fix Day 2)**  
4. **Cart counter needs refresh** → JavaScript fix
5. **Collection pages need styling** → CSS improvements
6. **Need code selling app** → Integration

### **✨ NICE-TO-HAVE (Day 3 if time)**
7. **404 page basic styling** → Custom design
8. **Performance optimization** → Speed improvements

- **Contact form test:** Submit form → should receive email
- **AI test:** Add content section → "Generate with AI" should appear

## ⚡ **Execution Philosophy**

### **Speed Principles**
1. **Working > Perfect** - Get functional first, polish later
2. **Delete > Debug** - Remove problems rather than fix them
3. **Copy > Create** - Adapt existing working code
4. **Test > Assume** - Quick validation after each change

### **Time Management**
- **Pomodoro Approach:** 25min work, 5min validation
- **Batch Similar Tasks:** All template updates together
- **Parallel Processing:** Multiple small changes simultaneously
- **Cut Scope Aggressively:** Only essential features

### **Risk Mitigation**
- **Git Commits:** Before each major change
- **Quick Rollbacks:** Keep working versions accessible
- **Incremental Testing:** Don't accumulate untested changes
- **Help Protocol:** Ask for help after 30min of being stuck
