    echo "✅ Auto-open logic now prevents opening on cart page"
else
    echo "❌ Auto-open logic not properly configured"

echo "2. /cart page should:"
echo "   ✓ Show actual cart items with quantities and prices"
echo "   ✓ Have working quantity selectors"
echo "   ✓ Have working remove buttons"
echo "   ✓ Have working checkout button"
echo "   ✓ Show proper translation text"
echo
echo "3. Cart drawer should:"
echo "   ✓ Open when adding items to cart (if not on /cart page)"
echo "   ✓ Have working controls"
echo "   ✓ Close properly with X button"

echo
echo "=== TESTING STEPS ==="
