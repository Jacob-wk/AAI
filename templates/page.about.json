In response, industry leaders came together to create the first version of <strong>ASTM F2970</strong> and launch the original <strong>Service Tech Level 1 training</strong>, now known as <strong>TCI-1</strong>. That collaboration laid the foundation for AAI‚Äôs mission today.</p><p>We now develop expert-led courses, certifications, and operational tools to support <strong>operators, staff, and manufacturers</strong>, all aligned with evolving safety standards like <strong>ASTM F2970</strong> and <strong>ASTM F1918</strong>. Our goal: to elevate professionalism, reduce risk, and help operators thrive in a complex, fast-moving industry.</p>",
