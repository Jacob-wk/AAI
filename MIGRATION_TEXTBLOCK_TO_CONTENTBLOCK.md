Summary
=======
This note describes the recent change that migrated the legacy `text_block` editor block to a richer `content_block` that supports images and video while preserving the original text-only behavior.

What changed
------------
- `text_block` (legacy) → `content_block` (richer): blocks were converted so they can optionally contain media.
- To preserve visual parity the migrated presets set `image_placement: "text-only"` which makes `content_block` behave like the original `text_block` (same card background/border and editor experience).
- A centralized snippet `snippets/aai-media-block.liquid` was added to render images and videos consistently.
- `sections/aai-universal-content.liquid` was updated to render `content_block` in grid and timeline layouts, and to apply the `.text-block` CSS class when `image_placement == 'text-only'`.
- CSS updates were added in `assets/section-aai-content.css` to ensure text-only blocks keep the original card styling.

Files touched (high level)
-------------------------
- sections/aai-universal-content.liquid — rendering & fallbacks for `content_block`
- snippets/aai-media-block.liquid — new snippet to render images/videos
- assets/section-aai-content.css — styling for media and text-only cards
- templates/*.json — many JSON templates/presets were migrated from `text_block` to `content_block` (presets were updated to include `image_placement: "text-only"`)
- theme.json / docs — small metadata and docs updates

Behavior and compatibility notes
--------------------------------
- Backwards compatible: when no media is provided, `content_block` with `image_placement: 'text-only'` visually and functionally matches the old `text_block`.
- Editor: existing text content is preserved by using Liquid fallbacks (e.g., reading `block_content` or `content` depending on which exists).
- JSON templates: the theme's JSON templates include an admin comment header (/* ... */). That header causes strict JSON parsers to fail; validation tooling must strip the header before parsing.

Why some text seemed missing
---------------------------
- During migration and conflict resolution a few template files were accidentally overwritten or had block entries removed. This led to text strings being missing (not empty blocks) in a few templates.
- A targeted restore from earlier commits (instead of a full overwrite) is required to recover lost strings safely.

Rollback & recovery options
---------------------------
1) Non-destructive workspace rollback (what I just did): checkout the historic commit into a new branch — safe and reversible. No remote changes.
2) Hard rollback of `main` to the historic commit: `git checkout main && git reset --hard <commit> && git push --force`, which is destructive to remote history. Do this only if you want the remote main to match that commit and accept history rewrite.
3) Targeted restore: extract specific template blocks from the historic commit and reapply them to current templates with careful JSON escaping — safest when only a few strings are missing.

Commit references
-----------------
- Historic commit requested: a2b5dfb09fd5339b2e81092c18c42dd6b2423bdd
- Last-known migration-related commits: (examples) 2c2a5b00c1065b3fd933eafb934c07a40f8b13ba, 3b436b4..., (see git log for full history).

Next steps recommended
----------------------
- If you simply want the working tree to reflect the historic commit for inspection, keep using the branch I created (rollback/a2b5dfb). No remote changes made.
- If you want `main` moved to that commit on the remote, confirm and I will perform a force-reset and push (I'll create a safety backup branch first).
- If you want only the missing text restored, list the templates/pages you see missing and I will apply targeted edits to restore those `block_content` strings using the historic commit as source.

Notes for future validation
---------------------------
- Use a header-stripping step when validating template JSON files.
- Run a quick grep for `"block_content": ""` or missing keys after migration.
