# Cart Drawer Implementation - Final Fixes Summary

## Issues Addressed

### 1. Cart Page Redirect Issue ❌➡️✅
**Problem**: Adding items to cart was redirecting to `/cart` page instead of opening cart drawer
**Solution**: 
- Fixed auto-open detection logic to check cart page path BEFORE attempting to open drawer
- Removed problematic form submission interference
- Simplified event detection to only listen for cart update events

### 2. Cart Page Content Issue ❌➡️✅
**Problem**: `/cart` page showed placeholder text instead of actual cart items
**Solution**: 
- Replaced placeholder message with actual cart item rendering
- Added proper cart item structure with quantities, prices, and controls
- Implemented full cart functionality on the cart page

### 3. Cart Page Functionality Issue ❌➡️✅
**Problem**: No buttons or controls worked after visiting `/cart` page
**Solution**: 
- Added comprehensive JavaScript to bind cart controls on cart page
- Implemented quantity selectors, remove buttons, and cart updates
- Added fallback functions for cart operations

### 4. Missing Translation Issue ❌➡️✅
**Problem**: "Translation missing: en.cart.items_count" error
**Solution**: 
- Added proper pluralized translation key to `en.default.json`
