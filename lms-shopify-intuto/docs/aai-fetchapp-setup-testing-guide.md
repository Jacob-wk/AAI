   - SKU: `AAI-TEST-COURSE-001`
   - Upload Intuto token files to FetchApp
   - Set download limit: 1 (single-use like tokens)
   - Configure basic email template

2. **Test Delivery Setup**
   - Create test order in Shopify
   - Verify FetchApp processes order automatically
   - Check email delivery timing and content
   - Validate token URL delivery

### Step 4: End-to-End Testing
**Priority: HIGH - Validates complete workflow**

#### Test Scenarios:
1. **Basic Purchase Flow**
   ```
   Customer adds course to cart → 
   Completes checkout → 
   FetchApp receives order → 
   Email sent with token URL → 
   Customer accesses course
   ```

2. **Error Handling**
